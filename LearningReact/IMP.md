1. {} - variables, expressions, func calls 

2. React does not render 'false', 'null', 'nan', 'undefined' - nothing is displayed
    0 or "" becomes an exception

3. && - first true hai toh 2nd try krege, false hai toh ni krege

4. import and export
    => default = only 1 ; can name anything while importing
    => named = can have multiple ; {} ; same name
    => mixed = can have both ; import default, {named} from ...

5. looping
    => for loop not allowed .map works
    => throws error if key is missing
